# Red Bus Clone

This project is a basic clone of the popular online bus ticket booking platform, Red Bus, built using HTML and CSS. While the clone lacks responsiveness and interactive features found in the original platform, it serves as a foundational project for learning and practice purposes.

## Features:
- **Static Layout**: The clone replicates the static layout of the Red Bus platform, showcasing essential elements such as search bars, booking forms, and ticket details.
- **HTML Structure**: Utilizes semantic HTML tags to structure the content logically, enhancing accessibility and search engine optimization.
- **CSS Styling**: Implements basic CSS styling to mimic the appearance of Red Bus, including colors, fonts, and layout positioning.

## Technologies Used:
- HTML5: Used for defining the structure and content of the web pages.
- CSS3: Applied for styling and layout design, albeit with limited interactivity and responsiveness.
- Git: Version control system for managing project iterations and collaboration.

## Credits:
- This project serves as a practice exercise for honing HTML and CSS skills.
- Inspired by the design and functionality of the original Red Bus platform.

## Limitations:
- **Non-Responsive**: The clone lacks responsiveness and may not render optimally on various devices and screen sizes.
- **Limited Interactivity**: Interaction features such as dynamic search results, booking validation, and user authentication are not implemented.

## Future Improvements:
- Implement responsive design principles using CSS media queries to ensure compatibility across devices.
- Enhance interactivity with JavaScript to enable dynamic user interactions, form validation, and real-time updates.
